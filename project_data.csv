VRroom Driving Simulator,,,,Neil Dodgson Tana Tanoi,"Virtual reality (VR) headsets are popular but they have challenges. We compare VR headsets against alternatives: large-screen “desktop VR” and multi-screen “CAVE VR”. VR headsets have the challenges that the user is isolated from the real world, is disconnected from seeing their own body, and lacks peripheral vision. All of these are significant drawbacks to an otherwise compelling technology. The alternative is to use a VR system in which the user is present in a room with a large screen or, preferably, surrounded by several large screens making a virtual environment (CAVE) in which they are fully present. We use a driving simulator to assess various things about the different types of VR: whether peripheral vision is of significant importance in certain tasks, whether tactile feedback aids in the feeling of presence in the virtual world, and whether the task has a significant effect on the ability to use different types of VR.",
Landscape-scale AR,,,,Neil Dodgson Lakshmi Krishnan,"We address the technical challenge of overlaying computer-generated objects on the real-world at the level of landscape. The key technical question is how to match landscape accurately so that we get a stable overlay of natural features that are of kilometre-scale.<br><br>The inspiration for this project came from separate discussions with Te Papa, the national museum in Wellington, and Port Nicholson Block, the Treaty of Waitangi settlement trust for Wellington. Both are interested in how virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) can be used in educating the public about their cultural heritage. For example, looking out Te Papa’s picture windows at Wellington Harbour, we imagined an augmented overlay where viewers can see the history of Wellington overlaid on the actual harbour or we could provide augmented reality headsets to members of the city council to visualise new harbour-side developments in their real-world context.<br><br>These applications of AR require that we can augment reality at the scale of landscape, where the user is observing things that might be kilometres in size, rather than at the scale of metres as in existing applications of AR. Our SfTI-funded research project addresses the precise registration of real and virtual landscape, which is one part of the solution that will allow such applications to be developed",
Training Novice Conductors,,,,Neil Dodgson Kenneth Young Donald Maurice,"“Technique is communication: the two words are synonymous in conducting” – Leonard Bernstein<br><br>Computer interfaces have moved from punched card to keyboard to mouse to touch. Gesture interfaces are likely to be next but face the challenge that gesture is imprecise and incomplete. Conducting is a domain in which gesture is vital to communication and in which a grammar has developed over more than a hundred years. It provides a test bed for investigating gestural interface.<br><br>Conducting is a challenging role. A conductor leads, inspires and coordinates the ensemble. The gestural part of conducting is one of the most complex non-verbal communication mechanisms used by humans: one expert providing gestural input to direct the work of a hundred other experts. It has been said that a conductor plays the orchestra like a large instrument, but this is imprecise. The gestural language provides only high-level information: each player interprets the gestures in accordance with their music, making it a truly corporate effort. Learning how to use conducting gestures is challenging because one either practices alone, which provides no feedback, or inflicts oneself on an ensemble, which is expensive and requires finding a forgiving group of musicians.<br><br>We are investigating this gestural language using recently-developed motion-tracking technology, the LeapMotion infrared hand tracker. Our experimental testbed is a system to automate the training of novice conductors. The aim for our testbed is to provide a novice conductor with training that puts them in an excellent position when they face their first ensemble. We are being guided by expert conductors and tutors of conducting.<br><br>We have undertaken a pilot study that addressed the simplest part of the conductor’s grammar: beating time. We based our pilot on the theory of beat identification developed by Wöllner et al. and the gestural style advocated by McElheran. Our pilot demonstrated that it is possible to detect beats reliably but opened up a whole slew of questions, including whether we are detecting beats at the same locations as a human musician (i.e., whether Wöllner’s theory is correct) and how much small variations in beating is accommodated by musicians.",
